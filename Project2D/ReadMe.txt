This is a Binary Tree made by Thomas King.

To start this applcation double click on the executable in the folder this ReadMe was located in.

Test case 1:

Insert the first node to be 0 (This should add a 0 as the root), 
Then the second node as 2 (This should insert as the 0's right child),
Then the third and fourth as 1 and 3 (The 1 should be 2's left child, and 3 the right child).

Then delete 2(This should remove 2 and put 3 as 0's right child and 1's parent),
Then 3(This should remove 3 and make 1 become 0's right child), 
Then insert 2 again(This will place 2 as 1's right child), 
Once that is done insert -1(-1 will be placed as 0's left child),
Then delete 0(This will remove 0 and make 1 the root and set -1 as its left child and 2 as its right child) 
Insert 0 back again(This will place 0 as -1's right child).

Then press Esc(This will end the program).
